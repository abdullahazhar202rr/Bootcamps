# My Bootcamps Repository

Welcome to my **Bootcamps Repository** â€” a collection of week-wise practice folders, exercises, and projects from multiple bootcamps that Iâ€™m learning and teaching.

Iâ€™m not a professional teacher â€” just a passionate learner sharing my journey to help others understand in a simple, beginner-friendly way.

This repository will include separate folders for each bootcamp. Each bootcamp has:
